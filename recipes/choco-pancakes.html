   <p>Chocolate pancakes are a delicious variation of traditional pancakes that incorporate cocoa powder or melted chocolate into the batter, giving them a rich and indulgent flavor. These delectable treats are perfect for breakfast, brunch, or even as a special dessert.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 cup milk (you can use regular milk or buttermilk for a tangier taste)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chocolate chips (optional, but adds extra chocolatey goodness)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg, then add in the milk, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract (if using). Mix until everything is well blended.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir gently with a spatula or whisk until just combined. If you're adding chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
    <li>Let the batter sit for a couple of minutes while you preheat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease the cooking surface with butter or oil.</li>
    <li>Once the griddle/skillet is hot, ladle the pancake batter onto it, using about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface, and the edges appear slightly cooked.</li>
    <li>Carefully flip the pancakes and cook the other side until it's golden brown.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate, and keep them warm in a preheated oven (set to low heat) while you cook the remaining batter.</li>
    <li>Serve the chocolate pancakes with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, fresh berries, sliced bananas, or chopped nuts. Enjoy your delicious chocolatey treat!</li>
