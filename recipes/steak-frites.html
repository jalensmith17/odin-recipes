    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the Steak</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 thick-cut steaks (such as ribeye or striploin), about 1 1/2 inches thick</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme or rosemary sprigs (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the Frites</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>For the Frites</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly-sized sticks, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Rinse the cut potatoes in cold water to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>In a large, deep pot or a deep-fryer, heat the vegetable oil to about 350-375째F (175-190째C). You'll need enough oil to submerge the fries completely.</li>
        <li>Fry the potato sticks in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pot. Fry them for about 3-4 minutes or until they're golden and crispy. Remove them with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Season with salt immediately while they're still hot. Keep the cooked fries warm in the oven at a low temperature (around 200째F or 95째C) while you prepare the steaks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the Steak</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the steaks out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to let them come to room temperature. This helps ensure more even cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or a heavy-bottomed skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat. You want the cooking surface to be very hot.</li>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to the hot skillet or grill, then carefully place the steaks on it. Cook the steaks for about 4-5 minutes on each side (for medium-rare) or adjust the cooking time according to your preferred level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Optional: During the last minute of cooking, add the butter, garlic, and thyme or rosemary sprigs to the skillet. Baste the steaks with the melted butter mixture for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
