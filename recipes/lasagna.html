    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.
                
                If making homemade meat sauce (Ragu Bolognese), cook the ground meat in a skillet until it's browned. Add the tomato sauce and any desired seasonings, and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes. If using store-bought tomato sauce, you can season it to taste.
                
                Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat or tomato sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking.
                Start layering the cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
                Spread a layer of meat or tomato sauce over the noodles, making sure it's evenly distributed.
                Add dollops of ricotta cheese over the sauce layer and gently spread it with a spoon.
                Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the ricotta.
                Optionally, add a layer of sautéed vegetables, white sauce (béchamel), or a splash of red wine, depending on your preference.
                Repeat the layers (noodles, sauce, cheese) until you use up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.
            </li>   
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to prevent the cheese from burning, but make sure it doesn't touch the cheese layer.

                Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the lasagna is heated through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
                
                Remove the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the cheese to brown slightly.
            </li>   
            <li>Once the lasagna is done baking, take it out of the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

                Garnish with fresh herbs, such as chopped basil or parsley, if desired.
            </li>
